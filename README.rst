Advanced Workflows
=====================

This engine was developed by **Gcoop Cooperativa LTDA** 
The original customer was Banco Credicoop Cooperativo Limitado of Argentina

About the engine
-----------------
This workflow engine is inspired by Sebastian Bergman "Design and Implementation of Workflow Engine" paper.

About the code
---------------
At this time, code is mainly in spanish, but, we want to traslate them.

Plugins
--------
This engine has a plugins system for actions. You can watch some examples in modules/Workflows/actions/ dir.

TODO
----
 * Translate source code
 * Simplify workflow creation and edit using wireit interface http://neyric.github.com/wireit/
 * Make a good documentation

Dependences
-----------
If you want beautifull workflows graphs, install graphviz in your server.

This engine works really good with Security Groups Suite.
